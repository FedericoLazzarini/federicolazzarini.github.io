I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University. Prior to joining Duke, I earned a Master of Science in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University, where I visited [BayesLab](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu) under the supervision of [Giacomo Zanella](https://sites.google.com/site/gzanellawebpage/home).
